This mini project is created to solve daily problem of my girlfriend. 
She has crossfit trainings which are only once a week and are very popular. This causes that often she was not able to sign up for these trainings.
One script (logger.py) is logging into her account (logging data are stored in .env file) and storing logged session in cookies.
Second script (app.py) is signing up for specific training sessions.
To automate the whole process, project was placed on VPS and scripts scheduled using cron
